# alea-iacta-sys-shintiara
A RPG system module for Alea Iacta Est implementing Shintiara RPG - 1st Edition

## Description
This command will roll a single d100 checking the result against the target and against the eventual critical range. Eventually - if an advantage or a disvantage is passed along - it will also roll the asset dice (d10) and use it to transform the result according to the Modern d100 rules.

### Roll modifiers
Passing these parameters, the associated modifier will be enabled:

* `-v` : Will enable a more verbose mode that will show a detailed version of every result obtained in the roll.
